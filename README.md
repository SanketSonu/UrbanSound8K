This is 2nd Semester - Data Mining and Machine Learning 2 project.

Abstract—
Recognizing different environmental sounds and
segregating them into different categories is quite an easy and
fun task for a human brain. But, when it comes to an artificial
prediction model to do the same, it takes a lot of complex steps
to classify the sound excerpts with the greatest level of accuracy.
This study focuses on classifying different environmental sounds
like a dog bark, drilling, gunshot, and many more using neural
network models like Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional
Neural Network 2D, and Recurrent Neural Network. Elaboration
on these models will be done in further sections. This experiment showcases different rates like for ANN with 73.06% of
accuracy for 10 fold cross-validation, CNN 2D using ReLu with
89.63%,96.24% of test accuracy for test and train accuracy. The
Third model is the same CNN 2D performed using eLu that
resulted in an accuracy of 76.4%. The Final fourth model LSTM
which is used to compare 8 optimizers activation results in % of
accuracy.
